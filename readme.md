# REST API

Imagine a **library** where you can interact with books. REST API methods are like actions you perform in the library.

## REST API Methods in a Library

| Method | Action in Library      | What It Does                          | Example Request         |
|--------|-----------------------|---------------------------------------|------------------------|
| GET    | View a book           | Retrieve information                  | "Show me book #123"    |
| POST   | Add a new book        | Create a new resource                 | "Add this new book"    |
| PUT    | Replace a book        | Update/replace an existing resource   | "Replace book #123"    |

## How Each Method Works

- **GET:** You ask the librarian to show you a specific book or a list of books.
- **POST:** You bring a new book and ask the librarian to add it to the collection.
- **PUT:** You replace an old book with a new edition.
- **PATCH:** You correct a typo in the book's title or update just the author name.
- **DELETE:** You ask the librarian to remove a book from the library.

> REST API methods are like polite requests you make to the librarian to manage books in the library.
